# sdnn

*sdnn* is a simple Deep Learning Network doing inference on images. it's implemented in pure C++ with many C++11 features. Aiming at full speed inference and build simple network on simple problem.

This is also a try to write a Deep Learning Framework from scratch. I don't know how long will this persistance, but I will do it as long as I have plenty of time. Many new things will also included not just CNN.


## Roadmap

- Simple CNN module;
- Back propagation;
- Image classification;
- some fancy GAN work;
- Complicated Object Detection Detector;

## Daily Log

2018.9.16: Just staring this repo, build it little by little. Writing a forward CNN layer first to do image feature extraction.
